# Logger Implementation and Console Statement Updates

## Overview
This document details the comprehensive process of replacing all console statements (`console.log`, `console.error`, `console.warn`) with a centralized logger implementation across the entire codebase. The update was performed to improve logging consistency, debugging capabilities, and maintainability.

## Logger Implementation
A centralized logger was implemented to standardize logging across the application. The logger provides different logging levels (info, error, warn) and ensures consistent log formatting.

### Logger Location
- File: `/logger.js`
- Implementation: Custom logger utilizing standardized logging levels

## Files Updated

### Backend and API Routes
1. `convex/email.ts`
   - Replaced console.log statements with logger.info
   - Updated error handling to use logger.error

2. `convex/test.ts`
   - Converted debug logging to logger.info
   - Updated error catching to use logger.error

3. `convex/debug.ts`
   - Replaced debugging console.log with logger.info
   - Added structured error logging

4. `convex/organizations.ts`
   - Updated organization-related logging
   - Implemented error logging for organization operations

5. `convex/migrations.ts`
   - Added structured logging for migration processes
   - Implemented error handling with logger.error

### Frontend Components

#### Admin Components
1. `components/admin/add-team-member-modal.tsx`
   - Updated error handling with logger.error
   - Added operation logging

2. `components/admin/team-settings-form.tsx`
   - Implemented error logging for form submissions
   - Added success logging for updates

3. `components/admin/team-members-table.tsx`
   - Updated member removal error logging
   - Added operation tracking logs

4. `components/admin/edit-user-modal.tsx`
   - Implemented comprehensive error logging
   - Added user update tracking

#### KPI Components
1. `components/kpi/update-kpi-modal.tsx`
   - Updated error handling with logger.error
   - Added KPI update tracking

#### Error Handling
1. `components/error-boundary.tsx`
   - Implemented structured error logging
   - Added error boundary logging

#### Objective Components
1. `components/objectives/create-objective-modal.tsx`
   - Updated form submission error logging
   - Added objective creation tracking

#### Landing Page Components
1. `components/landing/hero-section.tsx`
   - Updated navigation error logging
   - Added user flow tracking

2. `components/landing/hero/index.tsx`
   - Implemented authentication flow logging
   - Updated error handling

3. `components/landing/navbar/index.tsx`
   - Added navigation tracking
   - Updated error handling for auth operations

### Application Routes
1. `app/(dashboard)/(routes)/email-debug/page.tsx`
   - Updated email testing error logging
   - Added configuration test logging

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made
1. Replaced all instances of:
   - `console.log()` → `logger.info()`
   - `console.error()` → `logger.error()`
   - `console.warn()` → `logger.warn()`

2. Added proper error handling:
   - Try-catch blocks with structured error logging
   - Error context information
   - Stack traces for debugging

3. Added operation tracking:
   - User actions
   - System operations
   - Authentication flows
   - API calls

### Benefits
1. Standardized Logging
   - Consistent log format
   - Proper log levels
   - Improved debugging capabilities

2. Better Error Tracking
   - Structured error information
   - Contextual data
   - Stack traces

3. Improved Maintainability
   - Centralized logging configuration
   - Easy to modify logging behavior
   - Better monitoring capabilities

## Verification
- All console statements have been replaced
- Error handling has been improved
- Logging is now consistent across the application
- Each component properly utilizes the logger

## Future Recommendations
1. Consider implementing log aggregation
2. Add log rotation for production
3. Implement log filtering by severity
4. Add request ID tracking for distributed tracing
5. Consider adding performance logging

## Notes
- The logger implementation is now the standard for all new code
- All developers should use the logger instead of console statements
- Any new features should follow the established logging patterns
