# Fixes Documentation

## Approach
- Using existing shadcn UI components from our components folder
- Only installing core dependencies when absolutely necessary
- Avoiding duplicate component installations
- Reusing existing components when possible (e.g., using Dialog for Drawer, Popover for HoverCard)
- Using React Context for component state management when needed
- Removing unused components to keep the codebase clean

## Calendar Component
- Fixed type errors in `components/ui/calendar.tsx`
- Added `react-day-picker` package (core dependency) and its CSS
- Added mode="single" to DayPicker component
- Using default navigation buttons

## AspectRatio Component
- Updated `components/ui/aspect-ratio.tsx` to use native implementation
- Added proper TypeScript types and props

## Drawer Component
- Replaced vaul dependency with our existing Dialog component
- Implemented drawer functionality using Dialog with custom styling
- Maintained all existing drawer features (header, footer, title, description)
- Preserved the same component API for backward compatibility

## HoverCard Component
- Replaced Radix UI dependency with our existing Popover component
- Implemented hover functionality with custom timing controls
- Added mouse enter/leave event handlers with configurable delays
- Created HoverCardContext for sharing event handlers between components
- Used React.useCallback for memoized event handlers
- Maintained the same component API for backward compatibility

  - Can remove `@radix-ui/react-radio-group` as radio group is unused
  - Can remove `react-resizable-panels` as resizable component is unused
  - Can remove `@radix-ui/react-slider` as slider component is unused
- `@tanstack/react-table` - Required for data table functionality
- All data table components are actively used in the admin section

## Type Fixes
- Fixed type errors in calendar component
- Fixed type errors in aspect ratio component
- Fixed type errors in drawer component by using native types
- Fixed type errors in hover-card component by using native types and context
- Fixed type errors in popover component by installing missing dependency
- Fixed type error in analytics.ts for organization ID handling:

  - Root cause: user.organizationId can be either "SYSTEM" or an organization ID
  - Solution: Added conditional check to handle "SYSTEM" case separately
  - Impact: Maintains proper type safety while supporting super admin users
- Fixed type error in debug.ts for emailLogs table:
  - Issue: Type error when querying "emailLogs" table that wasn't in the schema
  - Root cause: Email logging functionality was implemented but schema was missing
  - Solution: Added emailLogs table to schema with proper indexes
  - Impact: Enables email delivery tracking and debugging features
- Removed type errors from unused components by deleting them:
  - Removed menubar component and its type errors
  - Removed navigation menu component and its type errors
  - Removed radio group component and its type errors
  - Removed resizable component and its type errors
  - Removed slider component and its type errors

### Type Error Fixes - organizationId in Users Mutation

- Issue: Type error in `users.ts` where `organizationId` was incorrectly typed as `v.union(v.literal("SYSTEM"), v.string())`
- Root cause: The schema defines `organizationId` as `v.union(v.literal("SYSTEM"), v.id("organizations"))`, but the mutation args didn't match this type
- Fix: Updated the `createUser` mutation args to properly type `organizationId` as `v.union(v.literal("SYSTEM"), v.id("organizations"))`
- Impact: This ensures type safety when creating users and maintains consistency with the schema definition
- Status: ✅ Fixed

### Type Error Fixes - organizationId in Update User Mutation

- Issue: Type error in `users.ts` where `organizationId` in the `updateUser` mutation was incorrectly typed as `v.union(v.literal("SYSTEM"), v.string())`
- Root cause: The schema defines `organizationId` as `v.union(v.literal("SYSTEM"), v.id("organizations"))`, but the mutation args didn't match this type
- Fix: Updated the `updateUser` mutation args to properly type `organizationId` as `v.union(v.literal("SYSTEM"), v.id("organizations"))`

- Impact: This simplifies the code and removes unnecessary dependencies on internal Resend types
- Status: ✅ Fixed

### Type Error Fixes - Unused Template Interfaces

- Issue: Type error in `lib/types.ts` where the `Template` interface was using a non-existent table name `"templates"`

- Fix: Removed the unused interfaces as they were part of a planned feature that hasn't been implemented yet
- Impact: This removes dead code and resolves the type error without affecting any existing functionality
- Status: ✅ Fixed
