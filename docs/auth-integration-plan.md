# Clerk-Convex Authentication Integration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive plan for fixing authentication issues between Clerk and Convex in the Alignometrix application. The plan includes implementation details, testing procedures, and monitoring strategies.

## Current Issues
1. Authentication token validation errors
2. Misdirection after sign-in
3. Role-based access control inconsistencies
4. JWT claim validation issues

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: JWT Configuration and Validation

#### Pre-implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review Clerk Dashboard JWT template configuration
- [ ] Verify required claims in JWT template:
  - [ ] `role`
  - [ ] `org_id`
  - [ ] `permissions`
- [ ] Document current JWT template structure

#### Implementation Steps
1. Create TypeScript interfaces for JWT claims
2. Enhance Convex auth configuration
3. Implement robust token validation

#### Files to Modify
- `convex/lib/types.ts` (new)
- `convex/auth.config.js`
- `convex/lib/auth.ts` (new)

### Phase 2: Auth Provider Enhancement

#### Implementation Steps
1. Create Auth Error Boundary component
2. Update Auth Provider with error handling
3. Implement session management improvements

#### Files to Modify
- `components/providers/auth-error-boundary.tsx` (new)
- `components/providers/auth-provider.tsx`
- `components/providers/auth-loading.tsx`

### Phase 3: Convex Client Provider Enhancement

#### Implementation Steps
1. Improve error handling in Convex client
2. Add session management
3. Implement token refresh logic

#### Files to Modify
- `components/providers/convex-client-provider.tsx`

### Phase 4: Middleware Enhancement

#### Implementation Steps
1. Improve route protection logic
2. Add error handling for auth flows
3. Implement proper redirect handling

#### Files to Modify
- `middleware.ts`

### Phase 5: User Management Enhancement

#### Implementation Steps
1. Improve user validation logic
2. Enhance role-based access control
3. Add audit logging for auth events

#### Files to Modify
- `convex/users.ts`
- `convex/schema.ts`

## Logging Strategy

### Frontend Logging
- Authentication state changes
- Token refresh events
- Route transitions
- Error boundaries triggers

### Backend Logging
- Token validation results
- Role assignment events
- Database query authorization
- Error events

## Testing Plan

### Authentication Flow Tests
- [ ] Basic sign-in/sign-out flow
- [ ] Social authentication providers
- [ ] Token refresh mechanism
- [ ] Session persistence

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Token expiration during active session
- [ ] Multiple device login attempts
- [ ] Invalid/corrupted JWT handling
- [ ] Network interruption scenarios

### Role-Based Access Tests
- [ ] Super admin access
- [ ] Organization admin access
- [ ] Team member access
- [ ] Invalid role scenarios

## Monitoring Plan

### Frontend Monitoring
- Implement Sentry for error tracking
- Monitor client-side performance metrics
- Track authentication flow completion rates

### Backend Monitoring
- Monitor Convex query performance
- Track authentication failure rates
- Log session analytics

## Progress Tracking

### Phase 1 Progress
Status: In Progress
Notes: 
- Created debug endpoint for JWT inspection
- Implemented structured logging

#### Debugging and Validation
1. Debug Endpoint Implementation
   - Created `convex/debug/auth.ts` with `inspectJWTClaims` query
   - Added structured logging with `convex/lib/logger.ts`
   - Endpoint extracts and validates:
     - Basic claims (subject, email)
     - Role and permissions
     - Organization ID
     - Custom claims
     - Auth metadata

2. JWT Inspection Process
   - Endpoint accessible via Convex client
   - Provides detailed logging of token structure
   - Validates presence of required claims
   - Reports missing or malformed claims

3. Logging Implementation
   - Added structured logging for auth events
   - Captures JWT validation results
   - Tracks missing or invalid claims
   - Logs authentication flow events

4. Next Steps
   - [ ] Test endpoint with authenticated user
   - [ ] Document JWT structure
   - [ ] Verify required claims
   - [ ] Update Clerk JWT template if needed

### Phase 2 Progress
Status: Not Started
Notes:
- Awaiting completion of Phase 1

### Phase 3 Progress
Status: Not Started
Notes:
- Dependencies on Phase 1 and 2

### Phase 4 Progress
Status: Not Started
Notes:
- Requires completion of previous phases

### Phase 5 Progress
Status: Not Started
Notes:
- Final phase pending previous implementations

## Implementation Notes

### Challenges and Solutions
(To be updated during implementation)

### Testing Results
(To be updated during implementation)

### Performance Metrics
(To be updated during implementation)

## Rollback Plan
In case of critical issues:
1. Revert to previous auth configuration
2. Restore original middleware
3. Roll back database changes if any
