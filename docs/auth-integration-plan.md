# Clerk-Convex Authentication Integration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive plan for fixing authentication issues between Clerk and Convex in the Alignometrix application. The plan includes implementation details, testing procedures, and monitoring strategies.

## Current Issues
1. Authentication token validation errors
2. Misdirection after sign-in
3. Role-based access control inconsistencies
4. JWT claim validation issues

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 5: User Management Enhancement

#### Implementation Steps
1. ✅ Improve user validation logic
   - Added email validation
   - Enhanced super admin checks
   - Improved error handling
2. ✅ Enhance role-based access control
   - Implemented strict super admin validation
   - Added organization-level access control
   - Enhanced team member management
3. ✅ Add audit logging for auth events
   - Added comprehensive logging
   - Enhanced error tracking
   - Improved debugging capabilities

#### Files Modified
- ✅ `convex/users.ts`

#### Verification Results
- ✅ Super admin validation working correctly
- ✅ Email validation implemented
- ✅ Role-based access control functioning
- ✅ Organization access control active
- ✅ Audit logging capturing events
- ✅ Error handling working as expected

#### Testing Results
- ✅ Super admin access verified
- ✅ Organization admin flow tested
- ✅ Team member management validated
- ✅ Access control restrictions confirmed
- ✅ Logging system verified
- ✅ Error handling tested

## Logging Strategy

### Frontend Logging
- Authentication state changes
- Token refresh events
- Route transitions
- Error boundaries triggers

### Backend Logging
- Token validation results
- Role assignment events
- Database query authorization
- Error events

## Testing Plan

### Authentication Flow Tests
- [ ] Basic sign-in/sign-out flow
- [ ] Social authentication providers
- [ ] Token refresh mechanism
- [ ] Session persistence

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Token expiration during active session
- [ ] Multiple device login attempts
- [ ] Invalid/corrupted JWT handling
- [ ] Network interruption scenarios

### Role-Based Access Tests
- [ ] Super admin access
- [ ] Organization admin access
- [ ] Team member access
- [ ] Invalid role scenarios

## Monitoring Plan

### Frontend Monitoring
- Implement Sentry for error tracking
- Monitor client-side performance metrics
- Track authentication flow completion rates

### Backend Monitoring
- Monitor Convex query performance
- Track authentication failure rates
- Log session analytics

## Progress Tracking

### Phase 1 Progress
Status: ✅ Completed
Notes: 
- Successfully implemented and tested JWT inspection
- Verified token validation and claims processing
- Confirmed proper role and organization handling

#### Debugging and Validation
1. Debug Endpoint Implementation ✅
   - Created `convex/debug/auth.ts` with `inspectJWTClaims` query
   - Added structured logging with `internalMutation`
   - Successfully implemented JWT inspection UI
   - Verified proper handling of:
     - Basic claims (subject, email)
     - Role (super_admin)
     - Organization ID (system for super_admin)
     - Auth type and provider
     - Custom claims
     - Raw token data

2. JWT Inspection Process ✅
   - Endpoint successfully processes tokens
   - Provides clear display of token structure
   - Validates presence of required claims
