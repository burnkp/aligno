# Analytics System Documentation

## Overview
The analytics system provides comprehensive insights into system usage, user activity, and organizational metrics. It is designed to help administrators make data-driven decisions and monitor system health.

## Implementation Details

### Analytics API (`convex/analytics.ts`)
The analytics backend provides several key metrics:

1. **User Activity Metrics**
   - Daily active users (DAU)
   - Weekly active users (WAU)
   - Monthly active users (MAU)

2. **Team Metrics**
   - Total teams
   - Active teams count
   - Team size distribution

3. **Activity Tracking**
   - Total actions tracked
   - Actions by type
   - Activity trends

### Analytics UI Components

#### Analytics Overview (`components/admin/analytics-overview.tsx`)
A comprehensive dashboard component that displays:

1. **Overview Tab**
   - Daily Active Users card
   - Total Teams card

2. **Activity Tab**
   - Breakdown of actions by type
   - Percentage distribution of activities
   - Activity trends visualization

3. **Teams Tab**
